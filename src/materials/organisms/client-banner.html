      <p class="client-banner-text">Exygy partnered with Girls Who Code to create a digital experience that supports their tremendous growth. We interviewed stakeholders, conducted data analysis, and built the entire site with a user-centric approach. The result is an interactive site that tells the GWC story, recruits participants, and effectively engages alumni, donors, and volunteers.</p>
